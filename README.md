# Connect The Numbers Game

This is a simple puzzle game using the FLTK GUI toolkit. It features saving and loading of puzzles in progress, time-based high scores, and configurable colors for the puzzle board.

This was one of my university projects during the spring of 2020. It was meant to be a 3 person group project, but I did about 90% of the work myself.
